"""Closed-form kinematics for the SO-101 arm.

Why not just use the URDF through placo, as the rest of this project does? Because the
SO-101's geometry is not generic, and pretending it is was what made the arm feel
arbitrary to drive.

Measured from ``so101_new_calib.urdf`` (see ``tests/test_so101_chain.py``, which checks
every claim below against placo's own forward kinematics to within 0.01 deg / 0.1 mm):

* ``shoulder_pan`` turns about the base vertical, through the line ``x = PAN_AXIS_X``.
  It selects a vertical *plane*; it does nothing else.
* ``shoulder_lift``, ``elbow_flex`` and ``wrist_flex`` are three parallel revolutes lying
  in that plane — a planar 3R.
* ``wrist_roll`` turns about the tool's own approach axis.

Two exact identities follow, and they are the whole design:

    pan        = -atan2(y, x - PAN_AXIS_X)
    tool pitch = -(shoulder_lift + elbow_flex + wrist_flex)

So the reachable orientation set is not "most of SO(3) with a bit missing". It is exactly
two-dimensional: **pitch and roll are free, yaw is dictated by where the tool is**. An
operator turning their hand about the vertical is asking for something the machine cannot
do in any configuration, and no solver weighting changes that — it only decides which
joints get sacrificed while trying.

Given that, inverse kinematics is a textbook 2R problem and needs no solver: place the
wrist pivot by walking back along the approach axis, solve two links to reach it, and read
the last joint off the pitch identity. One branch, chosen explicitly, so the elbow never
flips mid-motion; and it is exact rather than an iterate, so the joint targets shown in the
headset are the joint targets that get sent.
